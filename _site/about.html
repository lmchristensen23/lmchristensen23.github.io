		<h2>Hi There!</h2>
		<h2>Thank you so much for your interest in nourishology!</h2>
		<p class="about">Let me tell you a little about my journey and how I came to do this work that I love.  Growing up in the Midwest my family ate a very traditional meat and potatoes diet.  My mom is allergic to all raw fruits and vegetables so fruit was not a common sight in our house and our dinner vegetables were cooked to the consistency of baby food.  Like many children in my generation I grew up on sugary breakfast cereal, Kool-Aid, cold-cut sandwiches (on wonder bread of course), chips, soda etc. I knew little about nutrition besides the public school education of the food pyramid.</p>

    <p class="about">In high school I dabbled into eating low fat everything or just highly restricting calories. Neither of these two methods did much for my health besides create binging tendencies. In college I lived off Ritz crackers and peanut butter. I never drew the correlation between the quality of my food and the quality of my mindset.</p>

    <p class="about">In 2009 I welcomed my first child. A beautiful and miraculous little girl who was born with many severe health issues. Being her mother has taught me more about faith than anything I’ve ever experienced. At 6 years old she has undergone 4 open heart surgeries and is now in heart failure with little hopes of further medical intervention to improve her health. Looking back on what we have endured thus far is like looking at a road map that has lead me to the person I am today and I couldn't be more thankful.</p>

    <p class="about">Until 2013 I took my health for granted. When I look back I can see that my health was not so great. Headaches, massive mood swings, fatigue, cravings, etc. all seemed “normal” to me. After a routine physical showed that I had pre-cancerous cells my world took a massive shift. That day I vowed to change my health. I found a naturopath who informed me of a massive yeast overgrowth within my body and I took immediate action to cut out sugar, grains, dairy, and processed foods completely from my diet. The results were astonishing. I learned that weekly debilitating headaches are not “normal” and that my mood and mind clarity were finally level and clear. After a year of this strict diet I was able to cure my yeast issues and now I’m in the process of finding my balance (which is something we all should do daily).</p>

    <p class="about">In 2014 I came to realize that part of my purpose in the world is to help other achieve their optimal health. I found an amazing school called Institute for Integrative Nutrition (IIN) and enrolled immediately. It was one of the best decisions I’ve ever made in my life and I absolutely love being a Health Coach and helping others find their best self. I couldn’t imagine anything more rewarding.</p>

    <p class="about">I look forward to assisting you in making your life the best it can be.</p>
