							<h3>Achive Your Goals</h3>
						</header>
						<p>It’s rare for anyone to get time to explore their wellness goals with a trained professional. As a Health Coach, I create a supportive environment that enables you to articulate and achieve your goals. Throughout my education, I have been exposed to the most cutting-edge dietary theories and studied highly effective coaching techniques to help you find the right lifestyle that works best for you.</p>

							<h3>Tailored To You</h3>
						</header>
						<p>Instead of creating lists of restrictions, I coach my clients to explore basic improvements and implement gradual changes during our work together. As these pieces accumulate, my clients find the changes collectively create a much larger impact than they originally expected. We work on what you want to improve, and within the circumstances of your unique situation.</p>

							<h3>Holistic Health</h3>
						</header>
						<p>I practice a holistic approach to health and wellness, which means that I look at how all areas of your life are connected. Does stress at your job or in your relationship cause you to overeat? Does lack of sleep or low energy prevent you from exercising? As we work together, we will look at how all parts of your life affect your health as a whole.</p>

							<h3>Personalized Advice</h3>
						</header>
						<p>Together we’ll work to reach your health goals in areas such as achieving optimal weight, reducing food cravings, increasing sleep, and maximizing energy. As we work together, you’ll develop a deeper understanding of the food and lifestyle choices that work best for YOU and implement lasting changes that will nourish and balance you.</p>

							<h3>Educated</h3>
						</header>
						<p>I graduated from the Institute for Integrative Nutrition where I studied innovative coaching methods, practical lifestyle management techniques, and over 100 dietary theories; everything from Ayurveda, gluten-free, and Paleo, to raw, vegan, and macrobiotics, and everything in between. Most importantly that all of these theories and just that theories and each individual must find their own balance… with my guidance we will do just that. </p>

							<h3>Healing</h3>
						</header>
						<p>I have additional training as a level two Reiki practitioner. Reiki is an ancient healing technique based on the principle that the therapist can channel energy into the patient, to activate the natural healing processes of the patient's body and restore physical and emotional well-being.</p>
